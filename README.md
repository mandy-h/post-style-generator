# post-style-generator
A tool for creating post styles that are usable on Click Critters. It outputs HTML that is usable on the site; i.e. table and float-based layouts, but no grid or flexbox. This is an old project that was built with Vue 2. Imported from [https://codepen.io/mandy-h/pen/NWGjzOd](https://codepen.io/mandy-h/pen/NWGjzOd).
